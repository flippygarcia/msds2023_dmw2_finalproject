    "This project aims to understand a user’s movie recommendations based on their rating history and genre preferences.  This knowledge can bring business value to both the user and the creator of movies. The outcome of this study can help recommend the user’s next movie to watch. With sufficient data and user recommendations, the system can help determine the next big blockbuster based on the preferences and user ratings of the people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, the team uses the Movielens dataset with user ratings of various movies from the 1900s until 2018.  The dataset is split into multiple CSV files, such as movies.csv, tags.csv, links.csv, and ratings.csv. After initial data collection and Exploratory Data Analysis, the team performed Dimensionality Reduction, Data Clustering, and Frequent Itemset Mining. Lastly, the team developed a recommender system using Neighboord-based Collaborative Filtering, Latent Factor Collaborative Filtering, and Content-Based.\n",
    "\n",
    "With dimensionality reduction, the team transformed the data using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Then, user clustering by K-Means was used to cluster the data into different groups, such as lightweight and heavyweight. The team also used K-Means on the completed matrix using Coordinate Gradient Descent (CGD) to cluster groups such as Enthusiastic and Disappointed, with average ratings of 4.22 and 2.56, respectively. To determine which genre pairs have the highest rating or highest lift, the team used Frequent Itemset Mining. After various data processes were concluded, the team developed recommender system user profiles. These profiles show the user’s number of reviews, average rating, and liked genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize our findings, the team used a validation matrix to have a side-by-side picture of each recommender system with the DCG and NDCG. Finally, the team concluded that there is no best recommender system as this study showed a specific use case applicable to each algorithm. As such, there is room for improvement as improving the item profile content-based would be the most appropriate for this particular used case."

    "We applied SVD to reduce the dimensions at `80% variance` from `611 components`. So we only need `160 (74% reduction)`. The first cluster results in it being able to group each user depending on the density of their reviews. We analyzed, and `k=4` is the best cluster. Interestingly, the cluster members decrease as the number of average reviews increases. When we melted the table to look at how many reviews belong to each cluster, the distribution is quite balanced since each cluster has around 20k+ rows each, making it a good distribution that also makes sense on how it was grouped from lightweight up to the heavyweight type of reviewers. The result of this matrix can be helpful if we want to get a rating for movies. We might push it more to the ones who actively give a rating. It would be beneficial to look deeper at the extremes for people who rarely rate since they may have rated a movie high because it's really good or very low. If it's pretty bad, they spent time rating it out of potentially their emotions."

The distribution is also skewed towards the left side since the mean rating of the whole matrix is 3.43. The results can be maximized by studying the movies they watch and why they are always rated high or low.

All algorithms discussed in the class were applied, giving out the top 10 recommended movies. For all three users and the qualitative results will be discussed for each. We used `k=30` for users (`5%`) and movies (`3% for 1000`) for this exercise."

In this scenario, it depends on the matching movies rated. This one has the lowest quality of recommendations given that there are not many ratings from their reviews except for Paolo, our most active reviewer, where it has the most qualitative recommendation. Martin got some recommendations; however, the scores are small. Since the reviews are limited along with the related items, the values are too small, causing the DCG/NDCG calculations to go to infinity/nan. Almond did not get any recommendations because Almond has reviewed no movies in this data, and it cannot rank any related items given this; hence the outcome is just sorted based on the movieid not relating to any preference. We also need to note that this reflects the cold start problem where the recommendations are not yet of good quality given that the information gathered was insufficient and may need to consider other algorithms."

    "Both Content-Based Binary and Numeric Aggregation recommendations produced the same results. However, it was the unexpected results that it gave out movies that have multiple genres. There is no clear pattern, but almost all the appeared genres have been somewhat rated but not the top user preference. After further investigation, it was because of the weight given to movies with multiple genres. Since the movies recommended have around 3-6+ genres, it amplified the score of movies since the computation is per genre. If a user has rated multiple movies in different genres, it will amplify the scores of these multi-genre movies. This is why Paolo and Martin have near similar recommendations because they have already rated many movies. Almond has a slightly different result, but the quality of the results is still the same. Both algorithms have nearly similar DCG and NDCG scores."

    "Based on the results summary, we need to note that we needed to scale and recalculate the scores for content-based algorithms as it does not use ratings directly to recommend. For example, in the case of Binary and Numeric, we used cosine distance as the measure and recalculated it across the current ratings. Similarly, for FIM Rule-Based, we needed to recalculate the confidence scores and then take the `DCG` and `NDCG` scores.\n",
    " \n",
    "To summarize the output, we will look into the NDCG, as this is the best interpretation regarding the quality of the results. CF-CGD has the highest score of 1. However, the scores of CF-User based 0.995, CF-ALS 0.992, and CS-FIM 0.9965 have near-perfect ratings for the three users combined, meaning the quality of the recommended movies is on par with the ratings of the completed user ratings. CB-Binary-Numeric can potentially be fixed by having weights on the genre's or looking for another way to build the movie profile. Similar to CF-Item Based, if we have a more powerful machine and improve the code base, we can maybe use the whole dataset, and we think that it should produce high-quality results and have enough data to make the recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results from both clusters help identify user behavior on how `actively and heavily` they rate their movies. It could also be helpful to get more attributes for the user that tracks their behavior. Our current dataset is only base, and the team agrees that the output from the base algorithms applied suffices the expected outcome, but this can be further improved by having more attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent itemset mining answers the question: what movie genre should movie producers make if they want to have a highly-rated movie? The top three genre pairs in terms of `absolute support` are: `Action Adventure`, `Crime Drama`, and `Crime Thriller`. On the other hand, the top three genre pairs (antecedent-consequent) in terms of `highest lift` are `Children Animation`, `Mystery Thriller`, and `War Drama`. Movie producers could target producing these kinds of movies to increase the likelihood that their films will be highly rated.\n",
    " \n",
    "Genre helped us identify the connection between each movie recommended and explain the results. However, notice that multiple genres in each movie affected the result of our binary and numeric content-based recommendations. Thus, we need to improve the genre dataset or how we can build our item profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no best recommender system. We can see in this study a **specific use case applicable to each recommender algorithm**. However, we think improving the Item Profile for content-based can provide the personalized recommendation needed. We can see high scores for `NDCG` almost in all recommender systems. I think it's also because of the data quality, as there is a good amount of rating from the users we have randomly chosen. We also need to note in some instances that having serendipitous recommendations can help as this gives variety to the users, and we will never know if they want to try it until we recommend it to them.\n",
    " \n",
    "From a performance standpoint, the calculations become `more complex and exponentially longer` as the data grows. Organizations must ensure their algorithms are optimized, as computing power is expensive. Time is of the essence, given how fast-paced everything is nowadays. Nobody would wait more than 8 seconds for a result to come out as this is the average attention span of users over the internet, and given how our run times come out on some of the algorithms, this may not pass the criteria.\n",
    " \n",
    "Organizations can take advantage of and value this approach to evaluate their data set on a granular approach and see the quality of the results. This can help them decide which recommender system approach fits their dataset well along with its applicability and improve the algorithm further. We can see this applies not only to Movie datasets but to a similar rating approach like books, articles, and literature and even help decide which movies to produce next, books to publish, or even literature to write."
